# Leifer Labs

Tools and intelligent agents that help humans make sense of messy, real-world data.

We design systems that blend automation, AI, and interactivity—balancing human oversight with machine assistance to solve problems like:

- **Data discovery** across diverse sources
- **Semantic understanding** of datasets
- **Entity resolution** and canonicalization
- **Explainable data cleaning and quality assessment**
- **Memory-driven LLM orchestration**

Many of our projects explore how AI and orchestration frameworks (like LangGraph, Dagster, and dbt) can be combined to streamline end-to-end data workflows.

> Most Leifer projects start out private and experimental, but we’ll be publishing selected demos and tools over time as we make them more broadly useful.
